  <body id="s"><strong>DNA on filter paper</strong>
    <p>If you are receiving plasmids in this format, Addgene provides you with
      two spots of DNA for each plasmid. The paper&nbsp;can be stored at 4°C.</p>
    <p>To recover your plasmid:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To recover the plasmid, use a clean razor blade to cut out one of the
        circles containing your DNA.</li>
      <li>Immerse the circle in 30µL of TE and pipette to mix.</li>
      <li>After waiting for at least 10 minutes, use 2µL to transform competent
        bacteria.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Sending:<br>
      1) Mark a circled area with a pencil (not a marker pen) on a clean Whatman
      #1 filter paper (or equivalent).<br>
      2) Spot about 2 μg of plasmid DNA into the circle. Allow the filter paper
      dry at room temperature.<br>
      3) Insert spotted filter paper inside a plastic bag and heat-seal it.<br>
      4) Send by regular (air) mail.</p>
    <p>Receiving:<br>
      1) To recover the DNA, use clean gloves and cut the marked circle area
      that contains the dried plasmid DNA.<br>
      2) Using clean forceps, insert the filter paper into a 1.5 ml micro
      centrifuge tube. Add 100 μl of TE buffer, vortex<br>
      briefly and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes (UP TO 30 MINUTES,
      NOT OVERNIGHT AS DON’T<br>
      WANT DEGREDATION OF DNA). Vortex again and centrifuge the tube for a few
      seconds.<br>
      3) Remove about 10 μl of supernatant for use in transfecting E. coli by
      electroporation or chemical means.<br>
      Please do not try to use the DNA directly for any application other than
      to transform bacteria and prepare a<br>
      plasmid stock.<br>
      4) Store the remainder of the filter paper/TE mix at -20 or -80 C as a
      permanent archive in case that your plasmid<br>
      stock ever gets lost or if something turns out to be wrong with it.</p>
